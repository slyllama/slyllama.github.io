<h1>Dwelt</h1>

<p><b>I've put some more information on Dwelt up on my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8b3Pxx">portfolio here</a>! There is a video here too, which shows the game in action.</b></p>

<p><i>Dwelt</i> has been a conceptual continuation of the ideas first practically explored in <a href="scruffy.html"><i>Scruffy</i></a>! Most of what we could say about it is on that page, so here are some screenshots instead. I did do some writing more recently on this iteration of Scruffy itself; you can find it <a href="https://cohost.org/slyllama/post/4445671-experiments-in-downt">on cohost here</a>!</p>

<p>Meet Roselund, our (big) little hydra. She is very wise! This was modeled in Blender first, and then traced over.</p>

<p>Some concepts for the more astral components of the game. It was fun to work on a good old-fashioned watercolour block after going digital for so long.</p>

<p>Various UI elements and visual game mechanic components. These were very rewarding to make - we want to explore UI further.</p>

<p>More architectural concepts! Again, we've found a fun workflow starting in Blender and then working over guide renders.</p>
