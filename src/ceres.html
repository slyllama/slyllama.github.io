<p>Earlier this year I assisted <a href="http://twitter.com/areyoshi/">areyoshi</a> on illustrating for <a href="https://tidalwavegames.com/post/701715068133523456/ceres-the-planet-that-never-sleeps">CERES: The Planet That Never Sleeps</a>, a TTRPG module publication from <a href="https://tidalwavegames.com/">Tidal Wave Games.</a> It was an incredibly fulfilling project; my main role was to set up architectural environments, which I really enjoy! We're currently looking ahead to CERES' supplement publication <a href="https://tidalwavegames.com/post/731098117326471168/the-cybernetics-catalogue-for-see-you-space">Cybernetic Enhancements</a>, which recently successfully closed its Kickstarter round. Looking forward to being a part of that one, too!</p>

<p>There was a lot of Blender involved in this project, useful for shading, complex compositions, and eccentric camera treatments like the use of a fisheye lens. These are all things I want to explore a lot further in the future.</p>
