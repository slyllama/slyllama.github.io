    <p>Ahhh, hi there! This is page for our 2019 architecture school-work, Icons in Ink. We have many mixed feelings about this project, but it sure is something that exists and there is at least a little to salvage from it, so we're going to drop some snippets here. <b>Status: abstract done; just adding in the dry stuff now. Need to include images and then we're done.</b></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p><b>How can the icons of comics and architecture coalesce - in ink and type - to form a rich narrative which is both idiosyncratic and empathic?</b></p>

<p>In this thesis research, we explore the relationship between architecture, comics, and psychological and religious personal representation. We seek to describe and support the notion that a precise and emotive sequential portrayal of architecture - a realisation of the symbol or icon, rendered in ink - can enhance and enrich the personal narrative motivated by that sequence, through an integrated process of precedent research, storytelling, and creative exploration and investigation.</p>

<p>At the core of the thesis is the comic Stellaris, which directs all the techniques and reflection developed in the thesis creative research. Stellaris represents the work in the form of a creative practice; it is the outcome - represented in architecture, ink, and icon - around which all other bodies of research in the thesis rotate. The generative act of writing a story which is individual and psychological comes first, and out of that deeply embedded process comes a second act of piecing together its formal ideas, techniques, and intentions. Incorporated into our illustrative creative practice is a formal investigation of symbols in architecture, comics, psychology, and religion, demonstrated through the medium of comics and storytelling, both by architects making use of the form and artists building tectonic environments into their sequential narratives.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>Icons in Ink hinges around the understanding that creative and formal practices of architecture and story-telling are indelibly linked. They influence and inform each other, and together weave a messy living web of human interaction, communication, and habitation. As a colleague once remarked about the architectural industry: "if you can tell a good story, you can do fucking anything" (Spicer, 2019); and one strand of this thesis will delve into the curation and assessment of a series of built and paper projects into which the culture and process of characters, sequences, and narratives have been deeply embedded, in order to aid our own study.</p>

<p>But our own personal enquiry lies in fact with the inverse of this narrative - architecture flow, a direction which appears to be a little less traversed. We are interested in the potential and actual impact and possibility of enrichment that architecture has on narrative media like books, graphic novels, music, and poems. As will be established in subsequent chapters, through research, discussion of precedents, and analysis and reflection on our own work represented at the beginning of the book, the potential for an architectural practice and mindset to infiltrate traditional story-telling typologies goes far deeper than just the tangible inclusion of drawn or described buildings in a story.</p>

<p>Given that the very act of forming a book - physically manufacturing that pulp-and-linen narrative vessel and composing its constituent text and images - is a constructive and tectonic act, it follows that a deep understanding of architectural generation, iteration, and document is congruent and resonant with the procedures which back narrative building and communication! As demonstrated through our graphics (and as will be explained through this reflection), these two architectural methodologies (tangibly enriching a plot with buildings and environments and constructing the architectonic vessel in which the narrative operates) can combine to express situations, ideas, and feelings which might otherwise be more difficult to convey and reflect upon.</p>
