<h1>Endless Summer</h1>

<p><i>(Don't mind the cryptic title, it just refers to the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Summer">new legendary ring in <i>GW2</i></a>. Crab-dance time!)</i> Heya, Alec here, checking in from a hectic start to the year! Some new machinery arrived at work, an extremely cool <a href="https://www.dn-solutions.com/us/product/machining-center/vertical/dnm-6700.do">milling center</a>. There has been a lot of work in setting up and learning this device (alongside other things), but it's been really rewarding to see it in action. Machines like these change tools by themselves -- there is a large tool magazine at the top of the chassis, which rotates a tool to sit just about the machining center. This tool is then grabbed by the machine and fitted into the spindle. It's terrifyingly fast, and was thrilling to see for the first time.</p>

<p>On top of that, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring/"><i>Jade Spring</i></a> <a href="https://www.slyllama.net/journal/jade-release/">released</a>, woohoo! I can never thank everyone enough for their support and enjoyment of the game. Just the other day I got the most wonderful <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akoniwolfsbane.bsky.social/post/3mebfg7re322v">fan art from Kyris</a>, and I keep going back to look at it. I think I'll have to add those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typha_orientalis">raup&#333;</a> plants to the game! My time in <i>Guild Wars 2</i> itself has kinda stalled a little (thanks, life), but I've been doing some relaxing map completion with a good friend, and I need to do my LNY annual achievements sometime soon!</p>

<p>Coming up with a framework for a wholly new game has been challenging. It's not a case of having too few ideas as it is having far too many, and struggling to hone them and fit them together! I have a lot of old work and experiments, and I'm trying to look at it all through the lens of my experience on <i>Jade Spring</i> to work out what this next thing is gonna look like. Here are some disorganised thoughts which have guided how I'm feeling about <i>Dwelt</i>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Robots are fun and familiar! Working with a humanoid would take me a lot of time and effort which I'd rather apply to a course than trying to make work in a 'live' project. But I'm still very interested in making robots <i>feel</i> human, with dreams, flaws, and emotions.</li>
    <li>I'm growing to love the building and decorating genre, but <i>Jade Spring's</i> system, while being a good foundation, could do with more tools and quality-of-life features. I'm thinking specifically of a more <i>Sims</i>-like layout scheme for walls, floors, and architectural elements.</li>
    <li><b>Could cleansing and building be unified?</b> This is the biggest question, and one that I'm quite excited to develop more. <i>Jade Spring</i> had two distinct mechanics: building purely for decoration, and using the fishing mini-game from <i>GW2</i> to clear out blights from the garden. If building elements, decorations, and blights could all see and interact with one another (with conditions), there are opportunities for some really fun, interesting, and unexpected mechanics there.</li>
    <li>Raiqqo is cool. The background he gives to the world, and the idea of having a motivating force behind clearing out and decorating the garden was quite appealing to me. In general I like the idea of having an over-arching client for whom you work!</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think I've talked about it that much, but my broad goal with Slyllama is to make worlds and places -- mechanics (and, to an extent, even characters) being tools to help map out these places, furnish them with depth and history, and immerse the player in them.</p>
