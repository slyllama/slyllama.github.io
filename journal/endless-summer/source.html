<h1>Endless Summer</h1>

<p><i>(Don't mind the cryptic title, it just refers to the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Summer">new legendary ring in GW2</a>. Crab-dance time!)</i> Heya, Alec here, checking in from a hectic start to the year! Some new machinery arrived at work, an extremely cool <a href="https://www.dn-solutions.com/us/product/machining-center/vertical/dnm-6700.do">milling center</a>. There has been a lot of work in setting up and learning this device (alongside other things), but it's been really rewarding to see it in action. Machines like these change tools by themselves -- there is a large tool magazine at the top of the chassis, which rotates a tool to sit just about the machining center. This tool is then grabbed by the machine and fitted into the spindle. It's terrifyingly fast, and was thrilling to see for the first time.</p>

<p>On top of that, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring/"><i>Jade Spring</i></a> <a href="https://www.slyllama.net/journal/jade-release/">released</a>, woohoo! I can never thank everyone enough for their support and enjoyment of the game. Just the other day I got the most wonderful <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akoniwolfsbane.bsky.social/post/3mebfg7re322v">fan art from Kyris</a>, and I keep going back to look at it. I think I'll have to add those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typha_orientalis">raup&#333;</a> plants to the game! My time in <i>Guild Wars 2</i> itself has kinda stalled a little (thanks, life), but I've been doing some relaxing map completion with a good friend, and I need to do my LNY annual achievements sometime soon!</p>
