<h2>Jade Spring: Development Notes #4</h2>

<p>Hello everyone! Oh boy, I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s already April; <i>Jade Spring</i> is five months old (and 530 commits in). In March I put together a little <a href="https://youtu.be/BjZt3eDijF0" target="_tab">tour video</a> and set the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring" target="_tab">Steam store page</a> live, in addition to completing the game&rsquo;s little tutorial story and adding a bunch of features (like &ldquo;jumping puzzle mode,&rdquo; which toggles gravity for your Jade Bot, and a &ldquo;ping&rdquo; feature that allows you to find weeds and bugs hiding nearby).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just gotten access to Steam key distribution, so I&rsquo;m gonna start a broader private test of this tiny game in the next couple of days. I&rsquo;m really keen to have other people try it out as soon as possible, so I&rsquo;m thinking of <u>publically releasing the beta in May</u>, if this month&rsquo;s testing and additions go well! The version of the game would be a completable version of <i>Jade Spring</i>, just without some core decorations. The main thing I&rsquo;d be hoping to get back from a beta release are a lot of suggestions and bug reports which I can use to make the game as polished as I can. It&rsquo;s spicy because while I want to release the neatest and most crafted game that I can, I also happen to be an absolute newbie; and there are some things I can only learn and apply by seeing them happen in action!<a id="nerd" href="#ftn-1" style="border: none; padding: 0 2px; text-decoration: underline;"><sup>1</sup></a> So I&rsquo;m trying to find a good balance between the two, and I&rsquo;m so lucky to have such cool and understanding folks around.</p>

<p>If everything went well the plan would be to take the beta tag off between June and July, and release the game with an additional set of decorations, &ldquo;Xunlai Neon&rdquo;. This is an idea I&rsquo;m super excited about: a collection of cyberpunk-style Kaineng noodle stands, neon signs, air vents, and substation components! In general, I love the idea of being able to release small expansions to the game every now and then.</p>

<p>As always, thank you so much for following <i>Jade Spring&rsquo;s</i> progress. I started working on it as a way to learn game development, and to understand what I love so much about my time in Guild Wars 2. (Actually, a <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/art/digital-art/we-focused-on-creating-something-timeless-why-guild-wars-2-remains-an-artistically-unique-game" target="_tab">wonderful interview with their art director Aaron Coberly</a> was published recently, which explains my feelings quite well.) Seeing interest build in the game has been unfathomable to me, and I&rsquo;m super-duper hoping that I can put something out there that will be fun and relaxing, and perhaps resonate with Guild Wars 2 enjoyers a bit.</p>

<p><a id="ftn-1" style="border: none; padding: 0 2px;"><sup>1</sup></a> For example, setting up all of the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/" target="_tab">Steamworks</a> integrations (the pipeline which gets your game files on Steam, as well as configuring statistics and achievements) was quite daunting to work out! I used <a href="https://youtu.be/J0GrG-AffCI?si=TIM6ZQEfQRy5HbKU" target="_tab">this video</a> as a basis and it was super-useful. I also recently how to resolve <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts" target="_tab">merge conflicts</a> in the version control system, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;d worked on two different machines with two different versions (the laptop was offline at a caf&eacute;, heh). Going through the same-file conflicts in VSCode was cool, and I was blown away to see it all work out just fine. I&rsquo;m yapping on a bit, but yeah &ndash; nerd stuff!</p>
