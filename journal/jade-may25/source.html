<p>Jade Spring <i>is available on <a href="https://slyllama.itch.io/jade-spring">itch.io</a>! I&rsquo;m really hoping that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring">Steam version</a> will be available soon, but I am still waiting on a reply from them. The design above was built by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:byfeieo447alv4w7u4cus3eo">apricot</a>, who was able to make a whole new beautiful atmosphere in the game!</i></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful day outside. Flowers are blooming; birds are singing&hellip; On days like these, kids like you&hellip; Should try out the <i>Jade Spring</i> beta, which went up last Friday!<a href="#sans"><sup>1</sup></a> OMG, I&rsquo;m so thankful for the comments I&rsquo;ve received from the people who have played the game already. A special thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:byfeieo447alv4w7u4cus3eo">apricot</a> (<i>Jade Spring&rsquo;s</i> incredible principal character designer), our <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net/post/3lps3jj76b22s">testers</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/poksmox.bsky.social">Poksmox</a>, who very kindly tried the game out on his stream.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve collected a list of things I want to add and fix, and I&rsquo;m hoping I can have the first lot of changes done this week! There are things on there ranging from grass clumps to plushie decorations to (possibly) being able to duplicate a selection of items. I&rsquo;ve received a lot of great feedback and suggestions, and I also have a bunch more decorations in mind to add. (There are also thoughts of an expansion, hehe, but that will come a little later.) I really hope everything goes well with getting the game through Steam because it will make it a lot easier for people to update (which is the main reason I&rsquo;d planned for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring">Steam</a>). For now though, I&rsquo;ll also be adding a little indicator on the main menu of the <a href="https://slyllama.itch.io/jade-spring">itch.io</a> version which tells you if your version is behind the latest one.</p>

<p>Thank you again to anyone has tried out <i>Jade Spring</i>. There will be more updates to come here and on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net">Bluesky</a>; I&rsquo;m thinking of making a behind-the-scenes video describing some weird and interesting stuff behind the game! For example, there is an inaccessible weed which will haunt the underneath of the map forever; it&rsquo;s there so that the &ldquo;crumb&rdquo; system (weeds, bugs, and Dragonvoid blights) will never be fully unloaded.</p>
