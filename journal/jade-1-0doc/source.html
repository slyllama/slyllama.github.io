<h2>Jade Spring: v1.0 Development Document</h2>

<p> It's been a <a href="https://www.slyllama.net/journal/seitung-nov24/">year</a> since I started working on <i>Jade Spring</i>, and about <a href="https://www.slyllama.net/journal/jade-v1-2b/">five months since I <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring/">released it on Steam</a>. So much has happened in the intervening months, with moving house twice and having a car stolen! Developing <i>Jade Spring</i> has always been a really welcome pursuit in the midst of it all, even though sometimes it's been hard to set aside enough time to devote attention to it. Most of all, seeing people <a href="https://youtu.be/S7BHsbz7Wf8?si=RUFPIzMPf-EJ-vkl">live-stream and post their creations</a> was an absolute highlight for me this year, up with seeing and working with areyoshi bring the first chapter of their webcomic, <a href="https://kattabolt.com/comics/1#content-start">Kattabolt</a>, to its conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Jade Spring</i> has been in beta all this time, and now I wanna finally commit to polishing it and releasing it as the full game! Some people have been looking forward to playing the game once it exits beta, and I have kept them waiting quite a few months. I'm very interested in putting the game into a stable state so that I can approach it as a solid framework to keep adding decorations to. And I'm also looking ahead to developing a new game called <i>Dwelt: Iron Solstice</i>, which would be similar to <i>Jade Spring</i> but formed out of original designs and a little bit broader in scope. (My ultimate dream is to have <i>Dwelt</i> be moddable, so that everything in <i>Jade Spring</i> can eventually be polished and merged into <i>Dwelt</i>, with the garden-clearing and narrative capabilities being the same. But that's a conversation for another time!)</p>

<p>I've honestly been putting off the 1.0 update a little bit. I find things easy to start, and hard to maintain, because it's hard for me to not judge my work, see only the flaws in it, and want to discard a lot of it and start over. I've found that the best way of getting out of this rut is often to write out clearly a pathway for going back in, and testing and updating things -- so I thought I'd try and do that with you all! So below is a process of me working out the broad areas that need to be addressed for <i>Jade Spring</i> 1.0, and then breaking them down into proper tasks. Thanks for reading, and enjoy!</p>
