<p>Welcome dear reader, and thanks for visiting! This site exists to present my designs, and to express the kinds of work I do and would love to undertake for future clients. But more than that, it&rsquo;s a place to explore the design philosophies I want to adopt now and into the future. The broad concept that excites me the most is the intersection between art and science &ndash; forming a craft out creative discipline. I think few figures represent this area better than computer scientist Don Knuth (on the left in the first image) who, unsatisfied with the quality of printing in his first volume of &lsquo;The Art of Computer Programming&rsquo;, went on to write both TeX (<a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">typesetting software</a>) and <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/metafont?lang=en">Metafont</a> (type designing software designed to work with TeX). His correspondence with Hermann Zapf, and his discussion of the mathematical curves of the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; (both of which can be found in &lsquo;<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/dt.html">Digital Typography</a>&rsquo;) both reveal a rigorous intertwining of human and machine, expressing the confident, vigorous strokes of the type-cutter in mathematical code.</p>

<p>My wish is to practice and to study in this space, and perhaps to help others through doing so. I love working with CAD models in illustration workflows, for instance: <a href="https://kattabolt.com/comics/2">this</a> is a page by areyoshi where we produced models that could be manipulated to add some perspectival rigor to the art. The tag-line of the site is &lsquo;Illustrative Graphics For a Modern Age&rsquo; &ndash; I love the idea of working illustratively in a graphic field, using models, math, and automation to make such undertakings more efficient and economically viable.</p>

<h3 id="psychostratum">&lsquo;Psychostratum&rsquo;, Art, and Craft</h3>

<p>I want to undertake projects like these as a craftsperson rather than an artist, concentrating on exercising skill and following briefs methodologically with an attention to detail &ndash; but I also want to explore new ideas and means of personal expression. I&rsquo;ve made a number of attempts in the past (<a href="https://slyllama.net/alec/icons">Icons in Ink</a>, <a href="https://slyllama.net/alec/scruffy">Scruffy</a>, and <a href="https://slyllama.net/alec/dwelt">Dwelt</a>), but they&rsquo;ve all remained unfinished. I plan to work toward a synthesis &ndash; a series of journals which combine fantasy and non-fiction &ndash; exercising art, design, philosophy, and typography to fuse all of these ideas together. Recently I&rsquo;ve been writing a proposal and trying to get my intentions in order:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Rather than deferring to either a linear narrative or an incomplete tracing, I want to participate in the craft of sub-creation by mapping a network onto my initial exploration, invoking a psychological city that is centralised and activated by itself, and not by any single node on its plane. I hope to solve my issues with <a href="https://slyllama.net/alec/icons">Icons in Ink</a> and reach out through those problems to grasp freshly uncovered rhizomatic and locative philosophies, laying out an exploration which, while remaining accessible and enjoyable, <b>explodes a hierarchical representation of the human mind into a mapped plane of entropic yet measurable actions and &lsquo;lines of flight&rsquo; which express something of the fullness of a character in a decentralised sub-creative act.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply put, I want to design and author a rich depiction of a mind; heart; soul: thought and emotions expressed as geographic spaces and stamped into ink, pasted and spliced layer upon layer until it approaches the intricacy and density of real human complexity. It sounds silly, I know! But I have some ideas for how to make this expression of feelings and emotions successful by taking full advantage of the print medium, and by invoking what I&rsquo;ve learnt from media like <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/36526/house-of-leaves-by-mark-z-danielewski/">House of Leaves</a> and, more recently, Villeneuve&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/n9xhJrPXop4">Dune</a>. Looking forward to recording more progress here as I go!</p>
