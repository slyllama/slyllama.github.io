<h1>Thoughts For the End Of 2025</h1>

<p>Hello, everyone! Heads up: this is a bit more of a personal ramble. I just wanted to look back over the year (especially creatively), and see what could be coming up next. I'm very shy and awkward about writing about myself, but it might be a little interesting and constructive for the future, so I'll try it!</p>
