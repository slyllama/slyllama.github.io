<h2>Jade Spring: v1.1b Update</h2>

<p>Avast, after just over a week the first <a href="$ROOT/jade-spring"><i>Jade Spring</i></a> update is out! I know I keep being cheesy but I&rsquo;ll say it again: thank you so much to everyone who has been supporting and following the game. I am excited to keep making it better, and I&rsquo;ve been getting some wonderful comments and good feedback! Hopefully I&rsquo;ve managed to address a lot of it here; you can check out the changelog below.</p>
