<h2>Onward to 2025!</h2>

<p>Hello all, and happy new year! I&rsquo;m always a bit shy about writing about myself, but I&rsquo;m gonna give it a go. 2024 wasn&rsquo;t my worst year, but it was easily my weirdest. I had a lot of personal learning to get through, but I was very lucky to be able to participate in some really cool creative projects like <a href="https://kattabolt.com">Kattabolt</a> and <a href="#">CUSC</a> as an illustrator. And toward the end of October I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net/post/3l72wdu5t6g2h">began to work</a> on a Guild Wars 2 fan game (first called <em>Seitung Spring Clean</em> and then <a href="https://www.slyllama.net/journal/seitung-nov24/"><em>Jade Spring</em></a>), and finally managed to break through a big creative barrier I&rsquo;d been encountering for a long time, where I would find it very easy (and exciting) to start a project, but as complexity and decision-making increased the wheels would fall off relatively quickly &ndash; not this time!</a></p>

<p>So my first goal is to finish <em>Jade Spring</em> and gather feedback on it. It&rsquo;s been a great opportunity to study great environment/prop art and to implement my own, and to experience the entire life cycle of the development of a game. I believe I can have a MVP for friends to test in a month or two by keeping the scope aggressively low, and then promote it as a &ldquo;tiny fan game&rdquo;. There are plenty of fears swirling around my head! &ldquo;What if the game sucks?&rdquo; &ldquo;What if nobody cares &ndash; and rightly so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this even a worthwhile ambition?&rdquo; But I&rsquo;m trying to remind myself, &ldquo;what could you achieve if you acted in spite of those fears?&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Environment Art and Corinne</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become certain that environment and prop art is the area I want to hone and establish a career in. There&rsquo;s some kind of magic in game-space &ndash; in places that don&rsquo;t exist but which do <em>exist</em>; places which convincingly convey weight, depth, and soul as you move through them. <em>Jade Spring</em> has been a great crash course in how environments go together, and I&rsquo;m going to use it to continue to fill out my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/slyllama">portfolio</a> (already thinking of some themed collections, like <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Sanctuary">Mistlock</a> and <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elona">Elonian</a> decoration sets).</p>
<p>After that though, what comes next? The game industry is in a complicated position at the moment, the bar for skill and talent is super-high. I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have a secure job that let&rsquo;s me learn cool things, too. So, where I ended up using 2024 to experiment in a number of areas, I really wanna hone in on environment art and sculpting this year and go deeper into fewer projects, and use my job as an opportunity to improve my discipline (gosh does it need it) and my ability to break down complicated tasks.</p>
