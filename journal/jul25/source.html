<p><i>(Disclaimer, this was previously called &lsquo;July Thoughts&rsquo;, but time has been so weird that I&rsquo;ve only just gotten to updating and publishing it now&hellip; xD)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heyo everyone!! It&rsquo;s been a spicy couple of months, thank you all for your kindness and support. My car was stolen <span style="white-space: nowrap;">o&#x5f;O</span>, and I had to find a new flat to rent cause of a property sale, all at about the same time. Things have pretty much settled down now (the last step was getting my internet working, hehe), and now I have lots of thoughts, ideas, and projects in mind!</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring/">Jade Spring</a> 1.3b has been slowly coming together. It has a revamped decoration pane which makes picking categories much easier, as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net/post/3lu537koi3s2n">finding new and featured decorations</a>. Perhaps most importantly, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net/post/3ltsrgb2bos25">become a fish</a>! And 1.3b will mainly focus on Kodan/Lowland Shore decorations, as well as homestead design templates you can swap between. You should totally check out the video for a bit of a preview! Hopefully I will have a release date soon, this is a real passion project for me so I&rsquo;m trying to go at a healthy pace with full-time work and everything else going on.</p>

<h3>Toki Pona and <i>Dwelt</i></h3>

<img style="float: left; width: 140px; padding-right: 1em; margin: 0; max-width: 45%;" src="awen.jpg" />

<p>As a more portable hobby, I&rsquo;ve been working on my <a target="_blank" href="https://tokipona.org/">Toki Pona</a> (<span class="toki-pona">toki pona</span>). The language features a small number of words each with a wide semantic space. (&ldquo;lon <span class="toki-pona">lon</span>&rdquo;, for instance, could mean &lsquo;[being] at&rsquo;, &lsquo;truth&rsquo;, and &lsquo;reality&rsquo;). Toki Pona has a couple of writing systems &ndash; one of them is called &ldquo;sitelen sitelen <span class="toki-pona">sitelen sitelen</span>&rdquo;, the one shown above and on the left. It&rsquo;s a very spatial way of writing out language where the properties of things, for instance, are physically contained next to those things. I like to see it as a lunch-box, or a bunch of oddly square animal friends. (<a target="_blank" href="https://nimi.li/">nimi.li</a> is a great Toki Pona resource where you can click on any word and get the gist of its semantic space.)</p>

<p>And lastly for now, I&rsquo;ve been starting to look into settling on and developing my next game in addition to continuing to work on Jade Spring!! It will be quite small, but wholly original. Something with a mix of robots and magical spaces, combat and exploration. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of ideas about a setting called <a href="https://www.slyllama.net/alec/dwelt.html" target="_blank"><i>Dwelt</i></a> for many years, and now I might be kinda ready to depict at least a little bit of that world and feeling in some small way. Stay tuned! And thank you again so much for reading, and your support. &#128155;</p>

<h3>Science, technology, and scary stuff</h3>

<img style="float: left; width: 210px; padding-right: 1em; margin: 0; max-width: 45%;" src="awen.jpg" />

<p><i>(&ldquo;Let us <a href="https://nimi.li/awen" target="_blank">safeguard</a> the lands of all people!&rdquo;)</i> I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what I want to do next, as I continue to work on Jade Spring. I have lots of thoughts and plans for a bigger architecture game, but I am holding on to those for now. I want to go back to more artistic endeavours for a while, but it&rsquo;s been hard to escape anxious feelings about the world, the climate, AI, and all of that stuff.</p>

<p>One of the ideas I had for working through all of that into a more positive situation was to spend some time writing a comic publication approaching the scientific angles of these things from a curious learner&rsquo;s perspective. I&rsquo;m by no means a scientist, journalist, or skilled writer, but perhaps in trying to make sense of these big systems and technologies responsible for my worries, it might help some others a little, too.</p>

<p>Take generative AI, for example. I think readers here probably feel similarly to it as I do, that it&rsquo;s somehow frightening, inaccurate, unethical, consumptive, and hyper-capitalist all at once. I started reading into how it works and where its issues stem from, as well as ways in which technology can be employed and positive ways of conceptualising and using it. I think it could be a bit meaningful to put that kind of research and exploration into comic form, with colours, diagrams, little creatures, charcoal lines; and work through some topics that I find both important and complicated using that warmer and more personal and illustrated format. The same for things like renewable energy, passive housing, problems and solutions with traffic flow, what cloud seeding and weather modification is all about, and all sorts of things like that.</p>
