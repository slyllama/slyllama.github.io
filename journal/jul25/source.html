<h1>July Thoughts</h1>

<p>Heyo everyone, it&rsquo;s been a spicy couple of months, thank you all for your kindness and support! My car was stolen, and I had to find a new flat to rent cause of a sale, all at about the same time. Things have pretty much settled down now (the last step was getting my internet working, hehe), and now I have lots of thoughts, ideas, and projects in mind!</p>

<p><a target="_tab" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring/">Jade Spring</a> 1.3b has been slowly coming together. It has a revamped decoration pane which makes picking categories much easier, as well as <a target="_tab" href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net/post/3lu537koi3s2n">finding new and featured decorations</a>. Perhaps most importantly, you can <a target="_tab" href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net/post/3ltsrgb2bos25">become a fish</a>! And 1.3b will mainly focus on Kodan/Lowland Shore decorations, which I should have a bit more time and space to work on now. Fingers crossed I can get that out sometime in August because I&rsquo;ve come to realise that being a fish is integral to the game experience.</p>

<p>As a more portable hobby, I&rsquo;ve been working on my <a target="_tab" href="https://tokipona.org/">Toki Pona</a> (<span class="toki-pona">toki pona</span>). It features a small number of words each with a wide semantic space. (&ldquo;lon <span class="toki-pona">lon</span>&rdquo;, for instance, could mean &lsquo;[being] at&rsquo;, &lsquo;truth&rsquo;, and &lsquo;reality&rsquo;). Toki Pona has a couple of writing systems &ndash; one of them is called &ldquo;sitelen sitelen <span class="toki-pona">sitelen sitelen</span>&rdquo;, the one shown above. It&rsquo;s a very spatial way of writing out language, where the properties of things, for instance, are physically contained next to those things. I like to see it as a lunch-box, or a bunch of oddly square animal friends. (<a target="_tab" href="https://nimi.li/">nimi.li</a> is a great Toki Pona resource where you can click on any word and get the gist of its semantic space.)</p>

<h3>Science, technology, and scary stuff</h3>

<p><i>(&ldquo;Let us <a href="https://nimi.li/awen" target="_tab">safeguard</a> the lands of all people!&rdquo;)</i> It&rsquo;s gotten me to start thinking about what I want to do next, as I continue to work on Jade Spring. I have lots of thoughts and plans for a bigger architecture game, but I am holding on to those for now. I want to go back to more artistic endeavours for a while, but it&rsquo;s been hard to escape anxious feelings about the world, the climate, AI, and all of that stuff.</p>

<p>One of the ideas I had about working through all of that into a positive situation was to spend some time writing a comic publication approaching the scientific angles of these things from a curious learner&rsquo;s perspective. Take generative AI, for example. I think readers here probably feel similarly to it as I do, that it&rsquo;s somehow frightening, inaccurate, unethical, consumptive, and hyper-capitalist all at once.</p>
