        <p style="color: #aaa;"><i>Nayos was not easy on the Commander and I; the force of a Kryptis turret&rsquo;s blast left my plating cracked and my servos crushed and fragmented.

    <p>Heyo, Alec here with some quick notes about working on <i>Jade Spring</i> (formerly <i>Seitung Spring Clean</i>)&thinsp;! This is a little fan game I&rsquo;ve been making in order to experience the entirety of the game development cycle (and also because Guild Wars 2 &ndash; <a href="https://youtu.be/j1Zjbaxy07A?si=a5-6LGv-b272Bhbs" target="_tab">Cantha in particular</a> &ndash; is very special to me). I&rsquo;ve touched on many aspects of development that really excite me, so I&rsquo;d like to write a little bit about them and where I&rsquo;m at with fitting all the pieces together. This will be a mix of a progress log and some personal aspirations, so thank you so much for taking a look!</p>

    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

    <p>The design brief for the game is a simple one: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Homestead" target="_tab">GW2 homesteads</a> meets <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/613100/House_Flipper/" target ="tab">House Flipper</a>, set in the verdancy of an End of Dragons-inspired map. I am trying to keep <i>Seitung</i>&rsquo;s scope very small, but to think in a modular, extensible, systems-driven way! The truth is that my interests lie much more in environment art and music than in engineering, but the reward of having a system to drop all of that art into is quite satisfying. Two of my favourite parts of the process have been UI design and shader-writing. It&rsquo;s cool seeing painted UI architecture being built up to frame the 3D-world; and shaders are just magic &ndash; being able to make things wobble, ripple, dissolve, and aberrate feels like some kind of arcane spell.*</p>

    <div style="height: 36px;"></div>

    <p>A lot of the core mechanics of the game are now in place: you can move and scale decorations (relative to either their current orientation or world coordinates), and the &lsquo;fishing&rsquo; minigame used to clear weeds exists in a basic form. Next I&rsquo;ll be completing the feature set (rotation still needs to be implemented, for example) and fixing and tuning existing ones. Then the step I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to is producing the visual effects and a variety of decorations for building with, a practice I really wanna improve and develop.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m hoping to have something to share in the not-too-distant future; I&rsquo;m going to test (inflict?) <i>Seitung</i> on some friends as soon as it&rsquo;s in some kind of MVP state, and then polish it as much as I can before sharing it with a wider audience (while keeping the scope of the game agressively tiny and cozy). I&rsquo;ve already learned so much from it &ndash; both by looking closely at the beautiful props of the world of Guild Wars (getting distracted for perhaps just a couple of metas along the way, xD) and by implementing a game world with mechanics from start to finish. Thank you so much for checking all of this out!</p>

    <div style="height: 32px;"></div>

    <p>*Just a quick little tangent! A lot of the core mechanics and visual bases for <i>Seitung</i> came out of a dream-diary project I was messing around with at the same time, <a target="_tab" href="https://www.slyllama.net/alec/dwelt.html">Dwelt</a>. (Basically more prop art studies &ndash; <a target="_tab" href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net/post/3l6uim7ffbn2h">here&rsquo;s one</a>!) It took me so long to work out simple things like the MMO-style camera and the foliage spawner &ndash; I&rsquo;m really not so good with math. But having them done made it a lot easier to modularise them and put them into <i>Seitung</i>. If I can polish them enough I&rsquo;ll try and make public available versions of them, if they&rsquo;re gonna help!</p>
