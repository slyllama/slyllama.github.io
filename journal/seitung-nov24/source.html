    <h2 style="margin-right: 30px;">Development Notes #1</h2>

    <p>Heyo, Alec here with some quick notes on developing <i>Seitung Spring Clean</i>&thinsp;! This is a little fan game I&rsquo;ve been working on to expose myself to the entirety of the game development cycle (and also because Guild Wars 2 &ndash; and <a href="https://youtu.be/j1Zjbaxy07A?si=a5-6LGv-b272Bhbs" target="_tab">Cantha in particular</a> &ndash; is very special to me). I&rsquo;ve touched on many aspects of development that really excite me, and so I&rsquo;d like to write a little bit about them and where I&rsquo;m at with fitting everything together. This will be a mix of a progress log and some personal aspirations, so thank you so much for taking a look!</p>

    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

    <p>The design brief for the game is a simple one: <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Homestead" target="_tab">GW2 homesteads</a> meets <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/613100/House_Flipper/" target ="tab">House Flipper</a>, set in the verdancy of an End of Dragons-inspired map. I am trying to keep its scope very small but to think in a modular, systems-driven way which could technically facilitate enhancements and expansion in the future! The truth is that my interests lie much more in environment art and music than in engineering, but the reward of having a system to drop all of that art in is quite satisfying.</p>

    <p>A lot of core mechanics are in place: you can move and scale decorations (relative to either their current orientation or world coordinates), and the generic fishing minigame used to clear weeds exists in a generic (and untuned) form. Next I&rsquo;ll be completing the feature set (for example, rotation still needs to be implemented) and fixing/tuning existing ones. And then the step I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to is producing the visual effects and a variety of decorations for building with &ndash; this is the practice I really wanna improve and develop.</p>
