</div>

<p>Hello everyone! First of all, thank you so much everyone for playing and enjoying <i>Jade Spring</i>; I&rsquo;ve been so happy to hear people&rsquo;s comments and ideas since the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561310/Jade_Spring/">came out on Steam on the 13<sup>th</sup></a>. OMG, Mukluk covered the game (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ruGcFeGms" target="_tab">you can watch it here</a>), I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. And it also got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rMqilVrkepg" target="_tab">play-through and review from AngryZorric</a>. I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of decorations that I&rsquo;ve started, and all this makes me really excited to finish them and get them all in the game. Thanks again, from my heart, ahhh.</p>

<p>For now though, here&rsquo;s the 1.2b version of <i>Jade Spring</i>&thinsp;! There are a couple of new features but it&rsquo;s mainly comprised of lots and lots of bug fixes. I&rsquo;m hoping to make the game really stable over the next few versions while I continue to work on new decorations, and then put out a release version with a plenitude of new stuff. Here&rsquo;s a list of everything that&rsquo;s been changed and fixed:</p>

<h3>Changelog (1.2b)</h3>

<div class="warning" style="margin-bottom: 1.75em;">
    <p><b>Note:</b> the <i>Jade Spring</i> 1.2b version will be a bit bigger than it has been in the past (about 130MB). This is because the engine that the game uses (<a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>) has also updated, and I&rsquo;ve just moved <i>Jade Spring</i> up to that new version.</p>
