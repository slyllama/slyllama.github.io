<h1>Jade Spring 1.2<span style="text-transform: none;">b</span></h1>

<p>((You&rsquo;re gonna forget to put something here, aren&rsquo;t you.))</p>

<div class="warning">
    <p><b>Note:</b> the <i>Jade Spring</i> 1.2b will be a bit bigger than it has been in the past (about 130MB). This is because the engine that the game uses (<a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>) has also updated, and I&rsquo;ve just moved <i>Jade Spring</i> up to that new version.</p>
