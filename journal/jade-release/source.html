<h1>Jade Spring: 1.0 Release</h1>

<h2>Release changelog</h2>

<h3>Performance improvements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The loading of decorations is now streamed and threaded. They are added to the game in parallel after the map has loaded, reducing (sometimes substantially) the game&rsquo;s load time. If multiple copies of a decoration exist on the map, the game only needs to load each &lsquo;type&rsquo; once.
	<li>Increased performance and reduced memory usage&mdash;especially VRAM&mdash;by optimising the size and compression of textures in-game.</li>
	<li>UI panes now load asynchronously, reducing their memory overhead and increasing performance.
</ul>
