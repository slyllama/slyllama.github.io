<h1>Jade Spring: 1.0 Release</h1>

<p>Is it a plane? Is it a Principal Biomancer? No, it's the full release of the<i>Guild Wars 2</i> homesteading and decorating fan-game, <i>Jade Spring</i>, which I've been working on over the past year! This update brings new decorations and a bunch of changes which maes the game much more performant and faster to load. I'm very keen to keep adding decoration packs every now and then, but I'm considering the game to now be in a stable state to add on to! That being said, you can expect a patch in the next week or two with some small immediate additions I wanna make, alongside the inevitable emergency bug-fixes, xD.</p>

<div class="warning" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <p>For all beta players who have an existing save file: I've done my absolute best to make sure that this new version is fully compatible! But a couple of testers have reported some weird bugs which only disappeared when they reset their local cache, so you might need to do the same if you run into something really weird. You can find this location by clicking on the folder icon in the main menu. Do be sure to make copies of your settings, save, and decoration files - you will be able to put these back just fine.</p>

<h2>Release changelog</h2>

<h3>Performance improvements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The loading of decorations is now streamed and threaded. They are added to the game in parallel after the map has loaded, reducing (sometimes substantially) the game&rsquo;s load time. If multiple copies of a decoration exist on the map, the game only needs to load each &lsquo;type&rsquo; once.
	<li>Increased performance and reduced memory usage&mdash;especially VRAM&mdash;by optimising the size and compression of textures in-game.</li>
	<li>UI panes now load asynchronously, reducing their memory overhead and increasing performance.
</ul>
