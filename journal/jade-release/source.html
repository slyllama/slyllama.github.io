<p>Is it a plane? Is it a Principal Biomancer? No, it's the full release of the<i>Guild Wars 2</i> homesteading and decorating fan-game, <i>Jade Spring</i>, which I've been working on over the past year! This update brings new decorations and a bunch of changes which maes the game much more performant and faster to load. I'm very keen to keep adding decoration packs every now and then, but I'm considering the game to now be in a stable state to add on to!</p>

<h2>Release changelog</h2>

<h3>Performance improvements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The loading of decorations is now streamed and threaded. They are added to the game in parallel after the map has loaded, reducing (sometimes substantially) the game&rsquo;s load time. If multiple copies of a decoration exist on the map, the game only needs to load each &lsquo;type&rsquo; once.
	<li>Increased performance and reduced memory usage&mdash;especially VRAM&mdash;by optimising the size and compression of textures in-game.</li>
	<li>UI panes now load asynchronously, reducing their memory overhead and increasing performance.
</ul>

<h3>Added decorations</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Added Ventari&rsquo;s Tablet</li>
	<li>Added Railroad Bridge</li>
	<li>Added Drizzlewood Platform</li>
	<li>Added Drizzlewood Scaffold</li>

<h3>Changes and additions</h3>

<ul>

</ul>
