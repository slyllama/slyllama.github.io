			<p><b>July 2024.</b> A lot has changed since the 2D implementation of <i>Dwelt</i>; after realising that 3D development in Godot had become a lot more advanced, I had some success trying my hand at it. I've made the repository available on <a href="https://github.com/slyllama/Dwelt">Github</a>, and you can actually download runnable packages from the <a href="https://github.com/slyllama/Dwelt/releases">Releases</a> page!</p>
			
			<p>I should probably write some more about it at some point, but the long and short of it is that 3D Dwelt deals with a community of 'Scrapper' robots, a gang of mechs who harvest emotions from an infinitely big machine of souls all around them. It's another way to try and grapple with concepts of memory, death, and personhood.</p>

			<p><b>I've put some more information on Dwelt up on my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8b3Pxx">portfolio here</a>! There is a video here too, which shows the game in action.</b></p>

			<p><i>Dwelt</i> has been a conceptual continuation of the ideas first practically explored in <a href="scruffy.html"><i>Scruffy</i></a>! Most of what we could say about it is on that page, so here are some screenshots instead. I did do some writing more recently on this iteration of Scruffy itself; you can find it <a href="https://cohost.org/slyllama/post/4445671-experiments-in-downt">on cohost here</a>!</p>

			<p>Meet Roselund, our (big) little hydra. She is very wise! This was modeled in Blender first, and then traced over.</p>
			<img src="img/dwelt-3.jpg" />
			<p>Some concepts for the more astral components of the game. It was fun to work on a good old-fashioned watercolour block after going digital for so long.</p>
			<img src="img/dwelt-4.jpg" />
			<p>Various UI elements and visual game mechanic components. These were very rewarding to make - we want to explore UI further.</p>
			<img src="img/dwelt-5.jpg" />
			<p>More architectural concepts! Again, we've found a fun workflow starting in Blender and then working over guide renders.</p>
