<p>Welcome dear reader, and thanks for visiting! This site exists to present my designs, and to express the kinds of work I do and would love to undertake for future clients. But more than that, it&rsquo;s a place to explore the design philosophies I want to adopt now and into the future. The broad concept that excites me the most is the intersection between art and science &ndash; forming a craft out creative discipline. In the field of design I think few figures represent this area best than computer scientist Don Knuth (on the left in the first image) who, unsatisfied with the quality of printing in his first volume of &lsquo;The Art of Computer Programming&rsquo;, went on to write both $\TeX$ (<a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">typesetting software</a>) and <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/metafont?lang=en">Metafont</a> (type designing software designed to work with $\TeX$). His correspondence with Zapf, and his discussion of the mathematical curves of the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; (both of which can be found in &lsquo;<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/dt.html">Digital Typography</a>&rsquo;) both reveal a rigorous intertwining of human and machine, expressing the confident, vigorous strokes of the type-cutter in mathematical code.</p>

<p>My wish is to learn and operate in this space, and perhaps to help others through doing so. I love working with CAD models in illustration workflows, for instance: <a href="https://kattabolt.com/comics/2/#content-start">this</a> is a page by areyoshi for which we produced models that could be manipulated to add some perspectival rigor to the art. The site&rsquo;s tag-line is &lsquo;Illustrative Graphics For a Modern Age&rsquo; &ndash; I love the idea of working illustratively in a graphic field, using models, math, and automation to make such undertakings more efficient and economically viable.</p>

<h3 id="psychostratum">&lsquo;Psychostratum&rsquo;, Art, and Craft</h3>

<p>I want to undertake such projects above as a craftsperson rather than an artist, concentrating on exercising skill and following briefs methodologically with an attention to detail</p>
