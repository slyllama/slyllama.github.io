			<h1>Dream Spaces</h1>
			
			<p>There's a lot to talk about, dream-wise; a myriad of spaces, beings, and sensations. It's all a bit hard to describe so we thought we'd just note down the various things we feel over time, and then see what sense we can make of them!</p>

			<p><i>We tried writing out a dream in this unhinged style made for print; it was cathartic and if we can gather enough here we might do something a bit more substantial!</i></p>
			
			<h2>Recurring Places</h2>
			
			<p>These are the kinds of places that seem to show up again and again across planes, conveyed through dreams and super-imposed over our own world.</p>
			
			<h3 id="chorus">Chorus and Her Downed Aircraft</h3>
			
			<p>We know what this setting is gonna be as soon as it happens. It involves a little one who lives in the husk of a plane which has crashed in the jungle. We'll quote a part of the description we wrote before:</p>
			
			<blockquote>
			    <p>Little Chorus faces you once again, but it seems that she has changed and re-formed her body. With her short and slender form, a shock of bristly silver hair, bandages striping her legs and arms, and white cloth-ware, demarcated by crimson trim and tightened with cords of rope, there is much newness to take in. Her joyfully demonic smile hasn't changed, though; it never changes.</p>
			
			    <p>She stands, palms outstretched, in the center of the shrine that she has fashioned for herself. From above, it's just a speck of glitter in an ocean of moist jungle-green, but from where you stand at its threshold you have a clear view past the young Steward and into the burnt husk of the gigantic aircraft. Creepers, vines, and broad-leaves have infected the shattered windows and spilled onto the collapsed deck, a pungent smell radiating from the dense mass of decaying forest-tendons.</p>
			
			    <p>But it is her interior decoration that catches your eye. As she glides toward you, still smiling, her hand brushes the edges of a hundred steel sheets, suspended in dizzying arrays by myriad lengths of rope which have been criss-crossed throughout the plane's corpse. On each plate is a raised pattern of dots, each collection of bumps forming strokes and volumes of light and shadow that render a grotesque, horrific face - sometimes two; occasionally three - writhing together in a mass of skin, void, and anguish.</p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<h3 id="hospital">Hospital for the Faceless</h3>
			
			<p>This one was at its worst during uni! Not many dreams terrify us, but these episodes were really quite unnerving. They involved an underground hospital, carved deep into the bare earth and filled with an endless array of pipes, ducts, wires, HVAC systems, and spinning blades. Open surgeries were happening in vast dusty caverns, and a heavy silence permeated the entire endless maze of medical activity. Not to mention every figure was faceless, taut skin stretched over where their eyes, nose, and mouth should be. It'sa tired trope we know - but at the time, within its frame of reference, it was genuinely off-putting. Hope those flavours of dream don't return any time soon.</p>
