			<p>We haven't really developed much of a point of difference around this little guy yet. They should be customisable (to an extent) by the user, with options to choose from pre-made colours, patterns, and software themeing and configuration prior to manufacture. And they should also encourage limited, deliberate, and offline computing habits. One (ambitious) idea is to give the system a limited ability to be programmed. Here's a very cartoonish axonometric we did a while ago:</p>
