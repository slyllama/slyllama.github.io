<h2 id="oaq">Occasionally Asked Questions</h2>

<!--<p class="question"><b>Q.</b> Why won&rsquo;t <i>Jade Spring</i> be available on Steam for the launch?</p>
<img src="img/expand-button.svg" class="expand-button" onclick="toggleElementVisibility('a1')" title="Expand/collapse section." />
<p id="a1" style="display: none;">Unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t heard back from Steam about some further review they are doing, and I don&rsquo;t know how long that process is gonna take! As <i>Jade Spring</i> is a fan project, I have to provide reasonable assurances that I&rsquo;m not doing stuff with third party content that I shouldn&rsquo;t be. Please feel free to check out my own comments on this in <a target="_tab" href="jade-spring-content-use-statement.pdf">this letter here</a>. The game will be available from its <a href="https://slyllama.itch.io/jade-spring">itch.io page</a> on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, and versions (eventually) downloaded from Steam would be totally compatible with that one!</p>-->

<p id="saves" class="question"><b>Q.</b> Can I backup and share my garden with other people?</p>
<img src="img/expand-button.svg" class="expand-button" onclick="toggleElementVisibility('a2')" title="Expand/collapse section." />
<div id="a2" style="display: none;">
    <p>Yes! Once you've started playing <i>Jade Spring</i>, you can access your save by clicking the folder next to &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; in the main menu (or in the &ldquo;New Game&rdquo; pane), or go to <code>C:\&#8203;Users\&#8203;(user)\&#8203;AppData\&#8203;Roaming\&#8203;jade-spring</code> in Windows Explorer. Your story is stored in <code>save.dat</code>, and your garden layout is kept in <code>deco.dat</code>. They each function independently, so to share your garden you can simply pass <code>deco.dat</code> to your friend and have them replace that file in their own folder. (Just keep in mind that they won&rsquo;t be able to edit it themselves until they have gotten far enough through the game&rsquo;s little story.)</p>
    <div class="warning">
        <p><b>Note:</b> <i>Jade Spring</i> supports Steam Cloud, but I found that it often ignores manual changes to your save folder. Steam Cloud is good if you want to maintain your progress across two PC&rsquo;s, but if you are trading lots of decoration files with friends you might find it better to turn it off for <i>Jade Spring</i>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="question"><b>Q.</b> I found a bug in the game! (The software kind, not the buzzing flies.) I wish there were a lot more decorations! I have an idea for a couple of decorations myself!</p>
<img src="img/expand-button.svg" class="expand-button" onclick="toggleElementVisibility('a3')" title="Expand/collapse section." />
<p id="a3" style="display: none;">I would really love to hear about any bugs you encounter in <i>Jade Spring</i>, or any ideas you have for more decorations and mechanics. You can make a <a href="$ROOT/ticket">ticket through my site</a>, or you can contact me directly on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slyllama.net">Bluesky</a> or via <a href="mailto://slyllama@outlook.com">email</a>! I have a bunch more decorations I plan on adding throughout the beta, too.</p>

<p class="question"><b>Q.</b> What&rsquo;s next for <i>Jade Spring</i>?</p>
<img src="img/expand-button.svg" class="expand-button" onclick="toggleElementVisibility('a4')" title="Expand/collapse section." />
<p id="a4" style="display: none;">From the 23<sup>rd</sup>, it&rsquo;s beta time! Our original timeline in <a href="https://www.slyllama.net/journal/jade-apr25/">April&rsquo;s development notes</a> still seems to be holding up for the most part. I will be taking this time to fix bugs, address feedback, see how people are feeling about the game in general. I have never released (or finished) a game before, so I&rsquo;m really excited (and a little anxious) to see how it goes. Depending on interest in the game, there are a few next steps that I have in mind leading up to a stable launch and beyond &ndash; things like controller support are high on that list. beyond that, I have some fun ideas for an expansion called &ldquo;Xunlai Neon&rdquo;! It would feature new Kaineng cyberpunk decorations, a new map (probably inspired by Arborstone), and some unique kinds of pests to clear out of the garden (like the Jade arms that come out of the ground in the XJ-1 fight). But we will see how everything goes.</p>

<p class="question"><b>Q.</b> Wait, is that <i>Guild Wars 2</i> stuff? Is that alright?</p>
<img src="img/expand-button.svg" class="expand-button" onclick="toggleElementVisibility('a5')" title="Expand/collapse section." />
<div id="a5" style="display: none;">
    <p>I actually get questions like this quite a bit! &ldquo;The toolbar is very similar to the skill bar in <i>Guild Wars 2</i>&puncsp;; is that okay?&rdquo; <i>Jade Spring</i> is indeed a fan project for what is easily my favourite and most-played game, <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/"><i>Guild Wars 2</i></a>. A lot of my assets are intentionally designed to mirror the layout and painterly style of <i>GW2</i>, but they are all created from scratch; apart from being a fan project, <i>Jade Spring</i> has also been an opportunity for me to enjoy and learn all aspects of game development.</p>
    <p>ArenaNet opens up a pathway for us to be able to make <i>GW2</i> fan projects through their <a href="https://www.arena.net/en/legal/content-terms-of-use">content terms of use</a>, and you can see the ways in which <i>Jade Spring</i> conforms to these terms in <a target="_tab" href="jade-spring-content-use-statement.pdf">this letter here</a>. In short, the game is (and will always be) free, family-friendly, and absent of NFTs and silly stuff like that. You can also catch the disclaimer at the bottom of this page in many different places around the game and site.</p>
