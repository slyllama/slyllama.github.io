<p style="color: #888; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em;">&ldquo;A winter dragon, winding about their twisted spire of disquiet memory. Vines creeping; metals unforged; broadleaves heavy with weary tears of damp-scent. Echoes; order; wandering. Meet the gaze of the orrery; it will divulge that which the serpent conceals in its ages of mourning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dwelt is a world; a dreamscape in video game form. It&rsquo;s my hobby &ndash; a place to store my creations and express the places and feelings I see in dreams &ndash; and a portfolio. Dwelt is my scrappy attempt to combine my love of making music, 3D modeling, and illustration into a coherent and inhabitable place. I&rsquo;ve been spending time building a framework that maps, music, and items can be dropped in; I&rsquo;m going to finish a very small piece of the environment with one small puzzle and then share it!</p>
