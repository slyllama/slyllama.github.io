<p>The craft of sub-creation is a vital, beautiful, and substantive one. To witness the sculpture of fictive characters&mdash;a craftsperson stirring up and consolidating the <i>milieu</i> of histories, aspirations, victories, set-backs, and emotions that crystallise out of the broth of human experience and imagination into characters who come alive in print and performance&mdash;is to behold chaotic, passionate machinations which reveal the <i>nature</i> of things, brushing against or colliding with what it means to be human; what it means to live.</p>
